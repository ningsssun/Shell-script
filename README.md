#### Introduction:
It is a simple project for practicing the shell scripting.

#### Scenario:
An international company currently suffers from a huge bottleneck: each day, interns must painstakingly access encrypted password files on core servers and back up any files that were updated within the last 24 hours. This process introduces human error, lowers security, and takes an unreasonable amount of work. This script runs every day and automatically backs up any encrypted password files that have been updated in the past 24 hours.
